          <h1> Camping Fun by Kaitlyn Cortez</h1>
          <p class="printmaking_large"> I felt as if this projet really allowed me to work hands on and I really enjoyed the messy process that came along with it. It challenged me because while carving there were a few times where I would accidently carve out something I shouldn't have and I had to learn to work with the mistakes. </p>

          <p class="printmaking_small">This project was created in my Printmaking class. When I first started this project I decided on a camping theme. Then, I drew out twelve items that reminded me of camping. Then, these images were transferred on to a linoleum block by running it through a press. Then I had to carve out the images. Finally, I had to ink the block, place a piece of paper on top and run it through the press.</p>
